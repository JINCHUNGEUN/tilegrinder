A handy library in case you ever want to apply some logic to all/some [vector tiles](https://github.com/mapbox/vector-tile-spec/tree/master/2.1) in an [MBTiles](https://www.mapbox.com/help/an-open-platform/#mbtiles) file without having to worry about how to pull, decode, alter, encode and store them again.

It's pretty simple: you define a source and a destination - and a callback which gets called with a deserialized tile object as soon as the async grinder parsed another tile. The library transparently takes care of compression, protobuf and geometry de-/encoding and rebundling of the altered data into a new MBTiles.

Take a look at [`tileshrink`](https://github.com/rastapasta/tileshrink) to see what you can build with it!

## Requirements

* `tilegrinder` uses the native protobuf wrapper library [`node-protobuf`](https://github.com/fuwaneko/node-protobuf) for its magic

* To let it build during `npm install`, take care of following things:

  * Linux: `libprotobuf` must be present (`apt-get install build-essential pkg-config libprotobuf-dev`)

  * OSX: Use [`homebrew`](http://brew.sh/) to install `protobuf` with `brew install pkg-config protobuf`

  * Windows: `node-protobuf` includes a pre-compiled version for 64bit systems

## How to install it?

* Just install it into your project folder with

    `npm install --save tilegrinder`

## How to code it?

Following example will

* create a new MBTiles file `simple.mbtiles` containing the tiles of the first 4 zoom levels of  `planet.mbtiles`

* only the `water`, `admin` and `road` layers are kept

* while all points get moved by an offset of 256

```js
"use strict";
const TileGrinder = require('tilegrinder');

let grinder = new TileGrinder({maxZoom: 4});

grinder.grind("planet.mbtiles", "simple.mbtiles", tile => {

  // Only keep the road, water and admin layers
  tile.layers = tile.layers.filter(layer =>
    layer.name === "water" || layer.name === "admin" || layer.name === "road"
  );

  // Move each point a bit around
  tile.layers.forEach(layer => {
    layer.features.forEach(feature => {
      feature.geometry.forEach(geometry => {
        geometry.forEach(point => {
          point.x += 256;
          point.y += 256;
        });
      });
    })
  });

});
```

Which will generate following output:

```bash
bash$ node example.js
